## Welcome to Genesis Columns Advanced

This plugin was originally designed to generate shortcodes for every column configuration available with the column classes provided by the [Genesis Framework](http://www.studiopress.com), hence the name. We are pleased to announce that as of version 2.0, the plugin is completely standalone and does not require Genesis. The plugin now loads its own CSS styles, which can be disabled if you desire. See the FAQ for more details. By moving away from Genesis, we have been able to add new features, such as the inclusion of fifths, and it opens the door to more enhancements in the future!

Shortcodes are easily added using a custom button in your Wordpress editor. They can also be added manually if you so choose. See the FAQ for more details. Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/ortnpInn_YE) for a short demo on the plugin.

The plugin is developed by [Nick Diego](http://www.nickdiego.com) and Outermost Design, LLC.
